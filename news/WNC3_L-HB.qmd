The winning bids off the coast of Morro Bay were from Equinor Wind US ($130 million), Central California Offshore Wind ($150.3 million), and Invenergy California Offshore ($145.3 million).The lease sale is a significant milestone in meeting the state and nation’s goals to address the climate crisis.
