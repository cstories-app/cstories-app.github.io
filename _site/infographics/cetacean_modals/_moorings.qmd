Moorings are the below-water components of the floating offshore wind platform that connect the platform to its anchoring points on the seabed. Moorings can be made of polyester, polypropylene, or other synthetic material, and/or steel cables and chain. There are several different mooring designs that can be used for floating offshore wind, depending on water depth, type of platform, and environmental conditions. Most likely, moorings for California offshore wind will be taut to restrict the movement of the platform, the affected seabed area, and the amount of extra material in the water. 

The less material in the water, the less chance of entanglement with wildlife like whales and dolphins.
