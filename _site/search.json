    "text": "Moorings are the below-water components of the floating offshore wind platform that connect the platform to its anchoring points on the seabed. Moorings can be made of polyester, polypropylene, or other synthetic material, and/or steel cables and chain. There are several different mooring designs that can be used for floating offshore wind, depending on water depth, type of platform, and environmental conditions. Most likely, moorings for California offshore wind will be taut to restrict the movement of the platform, the affected seabed area, and the amount of extra material in the water.\nThe less material in the water, the less chance of entanglement with wildlife like whales and dolphins."

Increasing the abundance of marine renewable energy (MRE) projects would expand a clean and renewable energy portfolio that supports job creation, economic prosperity, and energy se- curity, reduces greenhouse gases, and contributes to climate change mitigation. However, as is the case with any development process, MRE projects require informed and collaborative project planning to overcome significant sociocultural, ecological and environmental, and economic barriers that may limit responsible and accelerated deployment. This challenge is exacerbated by competing values held by a diverse set of communities."
