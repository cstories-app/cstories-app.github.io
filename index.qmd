***Empowering Communities with Easy-to-Use Digital Tools to Participate in Marine Renewable Energy Planning & Development***

## Workshops

This Phase 1 project is active June 2022 to March 2023. We will conduct a series of workshops in California to solicit feedback for building out a prototype tool and apply for Phase 2 funding to build out a commercial application.

## Applications

Here are a few existing applications from other projects that we developed with functionality from which we'll ask for feedback based on what does and does not work for development of a new application oriented around informing and empowering community voices.
