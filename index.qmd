## Check out our website product under development

This website [cstories.app](https://cstories.app) is for organizing community feedback, whereas the website at [cstories.app/**beta**](https://cstories.app/beta) is where we're organizing product features (e.g. news, infographics, chat bot) into a dedicated website.

## Workshops

This Phase 1 project is active June 2022 to March 2023. We will conduct a series of workshops in California to solicit feedback for building out a prototype tool.

## Applications

Here are a few existing applications from other projects that we developed with functionality from which we'll ask for feedback based on what does and does not work for development of a new application oriented around informing and empowering community voices.
