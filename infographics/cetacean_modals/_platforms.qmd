A floating offshore wind platform is a concrete, steel, or hybrid-material structure on which a wind turbine is installed. The floating platform provides the turbine with buoyancy and stability â€“ essentially to keep it above water and in its correct operational orientation. Because a floating offshore wind platform itself is not attached to the seabed, it requires moorings and anchors to distribute its mass and keep it in place.
