::: {#turbine-sound-info}
Unlike fixed offshore wind turbine platforms, floating offshore wind project development will **not** require seismic exploration (airguns), excavation with explosives, dredging, or pile-driving. However, development and operation of floating offshore wind projects will not be without any unnatural sounds. There will be sounds generated by ship operations and those from mechanical operation of the wind turbine itself.
